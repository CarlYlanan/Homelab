# Carl Ylanan's Homelab Server

This repository documents my personal homelab setup, running multiple containerized services on a repurposed ASUS TUF A15 laptop. The system is built for media hosting, file management, monitoring, and light experimentation with AI tooling â€” all using Docker on Ubuntu Desktop.

---

## Overview

The homelab is powered by Docker Compose and focuses on three key principles:

- Simplicity and maintainability  
- Secure local network access  
- Minimal external exposure  

Services are split across categories such as media streaming, downloads, monitoring, productivity, and self-hosted tools.

## System Information

**Host OS:** Ubuntu Desktop (LTS)  
**Hardware:** ASUS TUF A15  
**CPU:** Ryzen 7 4800H  
**GPU:** GTX 1660 Ti Mobile  
**Storage:** External USB drives (2TB+ total)  
**Networking:** Custom Docker bridge network + Samba file sharing  
**Access Control:** Only Plex is exposed to the internet through strict firewall rules

## Installation Steps

### 1. Update and upgrade the system

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 2. Install essential tools

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl wget git htop net-tools gparted gnome-disk-utility apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg2 software-properties-common
```

### 3. Install Docker

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**Note:** Log out and back in (or reboot) to apply Docker group changes.

### 4. Install Docker Compose

```bash
sudo apt install -y docker-compose
```

### 5. Create base directory structure and Docker network

```bash
mkdir -p ~/homelab/{configs,data}
cd ~/homelab
docker network create homelab
```

---

## Running Services

Each app is defined in its own `docker-compose.yml` file within `~/homelab/configs/`. Services are connected to a shared `homelab` Docker network to enable internal communication. Data is persisted in the `~/homelab/data/` directory.

To start a service:

```bash
cd ~/homelab/configs/<app-name>
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Samba Setup

This section outlines how to mount external drives and expose them via Samba for local file sharing.

### 1. Create mount points

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/2TB /mnt/4TB
```

### 2. Edit `/etc/fstab` for persistent mounting

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Example entry:
```
#UUID=2695-88E0 /mnt/2TB exfat defaults,uid=65534,gid=65534,fmask=0000,dmask=0000 0 0
UUID=344A-E2BC /mnt/4TB exfat defaults,uid=65534,gid=65534,fmask=0000,dmask=0000 0 0
```

Use `lsblk` or `blkid` to find the correct UUIDs for your drives.

### 3. Optional: Bind-mount specific folder (e.g. for ROMs)

```bash
sudo mount --bind /mnt/4TB/Games/Emulations /home/ylanan/ROMS
```

### 4. Set permissions

```bash
sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/4TB
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/4TB

sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/2TB
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/2TB
```

### 5. Install Samba

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install exfat-fuse samba -y
```

### 6. Configure shares

```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add at the bottom:

```
[4TB]
   path = /mnt/4TB
   browseable = yes
   writable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   guest only = yes
   create mask = 0777
   directory mask = 0777
   force user = nobody
   force group = nogroup

[2TB]
   path = /mnt/2TB
   browseable = yes
   writable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   guest only = yes
   create mask = 0777
   directory mask = 0777
   force user = nobody
   force group = nogroup
```

### 7. Final steps

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
sudo ufw allow Samba
```

Then reboot or manually verify:

```bash
ls -ld /mnt/2TB /mnt/4TB
```
