# Carl Ylanan's Homelab Server

This repository documents my personal homelab setup, running multiple containerized services on a repurposed ASUS TUF A15 laptop. The system is built for media hosting, file management, monitoring, and light experimentation with AI tooling â€” all using Docker on Ubuntu Desktop.

---

## Overview

The homelab is powered by Docker Compose and focuses on three key principles:

- Simplicity and maintainability  
- Secure local network access  
- Minimal external exposure  

Services are split across categories such as media streaming, downloads, monitoring, productivity, and self-hosted tools.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Update and upgrade the system

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 2. Install essential tools

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl wget git htop net-tools gparted gnome-disk-utility apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg2 software-properties-common
```

### 3. Install Docker

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**Note:** Log out and back in (or reboot) to apply Docker group changes.

### 4. Install Docker Compose

```bash
sudo apt install -y docker-compose
```

### 5. Create base directory structure and Docker network

```bash
mkdir -p ~/homelab/{configs,data}
cd ~/homelab
docker network create homelab
```

---

## Running Services

Each app is defined in its own `docker-compose.yml` file within `~/homelab/configs/`. Services are connected to a shared `homelab` Docker network to enable internal communication. Data is persisted in the `~/homelab/data/` directory.

To start a service:

```bash
cd ~/homelab/configs/<app-name>
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Notes

- All services are self-hosted and manually maintained.  
- The setup prioritizes local use with minimal external ports exposed.  
- File sharing is done using Samba for compatibility with Windows and macOS devices.  
- Drives are monitored regularly with Scrutiny for early failure detection.
